                    <h2>The Truth Behind Building Collapse</h2>
                    <p>
                        In Turkey's most devastating earthquakes, the biggest destruction came from preventable design flaws. During the 2023 Turkey-Syria Earthquakes, which
                        were responsible for over 50,000 deaths, the worst damage came from buildings that were already unsafe.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If we want to save lives in future earthquakes, we have to understand why so many buildings failed in the first place.
                        This section breaks down why so many structures failed and the solutions that could've prevented thousands of them from collapsing.

                            <p>
                                Turkey's 2023 earthquakes were not just devastating because of the strong shaking; many buildings themselves were
                                already weak. Insufficient construction, materials, and inspections made structures more likely to fall.
                            </p>
                            <p>The most common issues were:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Soft-story buildings</strong>, where open spaces for retail or parking caused the upper floors to collapse downward</li>
                                <li><strong>Low quality concrete</strong> destroyed by ground movement</li>
                                <li>Incorrect placements and <strong>lack of steel reinforcements</strong></li>
                                <li>Safety rules that were ignored, and <strong>poor inspections</strong> that failed to catch these issues</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>

                            <h2>Constructing Earthquake-Safe Buildings</h2>
                            <p>
                                Earthquake-safe buildings are designed to move without collapsing. Instead of staying stiff, they use 
                                structural elements that can bend and absorb shaking. This allows the structure to stay standing even during strong earthquakes. 
                            </p>
                            <p>Key features of earthquake-resistant design include:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Ductility:</strong> materials and connections that can bend without breaking (stretchable steel reinforcements)</li>
                                <li><strong>Shear walls:</strong> stiff walls that prevent swaying</li>
                                <li><strong>Strong columns & reinforced beams:</strong> keep floors tied together as one unit.</li>
                                <li><strong>Proper rebar placement:</strong> correct use of steel reinforcements that hold concrete together during shaking</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>

                            <p>
                                Fortunately, it's very possible to reduce the risk of future disasters. Turkey can move forward by
                                strengthening existing buildings and making sure new ones are built safely.
                            </p>
                            <p>Here's what actually makes a difference:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Retrofitting older structures</strong> with braces and shear walls.</li>
                                <li>Ensuring that builders use <strong>stronger materials</strong> instead of cutting corners</li>
                                <li>Following <strong>seismic building codes</strong> in new builds</li>
                                <li>Conducting <strong>real and transparent</strong> inspections</li>
                                <li>Making sure the government <strong>enforces the rules</strong> and ensures unsafe buildings aren't approved</li>
                            </ul>
