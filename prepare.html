  <h2>Why Preparation Matters</h2>
  <p>
    Preparation plays a big role in staying safe during an earthquake.  
    When people know what to do, they react faster and avoid panic.  
    Getting ready helps reduce injuries, protects families, and keeps the community stronger.  
    Simple steps like preparing a safety kit, securing furniture, and learning safe spots  
    can make a big difference when the shaking starts.

<!-- And Remember -->
<section class="remember">
  <h2>And Remember</h2>
  <p>
    Always stay informed and review your emergency plan regularly.  
    Practicing earthquake drills and teaching others what to do helps everyone stay calm.  
    A few minutes of preparation today can save lives in the future.  
    Safety begins with awareness — and every small step matters.
